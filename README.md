Four Javascript projects/assignments

I created 4 Javascript projects.

The datatype project shows how to create an app that indicates whether the input is a string or a number.

The second project is a Student management; where we created an app that enables us to delete a student name from the list of students.

The third project is a quiz app and the last project is a number Guessgame project.
